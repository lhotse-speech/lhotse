    Override Lhotse's global threshold for allowed audio duration mismatch between the

    Some scenarios when a mismatch can happen:

        - the :class:`.Recording` manifest duration is rounded off too much
            (i.e., bad user input, but too inconvenient to go back and fix the manifests)

        - data augmentation changes the number of samples a bit in a difficult to predict way

    the value found in the :class:`.Recording` manifest.

@dataclass
class Recording:
    """
    The :class:`~lhotse.audio.Recording` manifest describes the recordings in a given corpus.
    It contains information about the recording, such as its path(s), duration, the number of samples, etc.
    It allows to represent multiple channels coming from one or more files.

    This manifest does not specify any segmentation information or supervision such as the transcript or the speaker
    -- we use :class:`~lhotse.supervision.SupervisionSegment` for that.

    Note that :class:`~lhotse.audio.Recording` can represent both a single utterance (e.g., in LibriSpeech)
    and a 1-hour session with multiple channels and speakers (e.g., in AMI).
    In the latter case, it is partitioned into data suitable for model training using :class:`~lhotse.cut.Cut`.

    .. hint::
        Lhotse reads audio recordings using `pysoundfile`_ and `audioread`_, similarly to librosa,
        to support multiple audio formats. For OPUS files we require ffmpeg to be installed.

    .. hint::
        Since we support importing Kaldi data dirs, if ``wav.scp`` contains unix pipes,
        :class:`~lhotse.audio.Recording` will also handle them correctly.

    Examples

        A :class:`~lhotse.audio.Recording` can be simply created from a local audio file::

            >>> from lhotse import RecordingSet, Recording, AudioSource
            >>> recording = Recording.from_file('meeting.wav')
            >>> recording
            Recording(
                id='meeting',
                sources=[AudioSource(type='file', channels=[0], source='meeting.wav')],
                sampling_rate=16000,
                num_samples=57600000,
                duration=3600.0,
                transforms=None
            )

        This manifest can be easily converted to a Python dict and serialized to JSON/JSONL/YAML/etc::

            >>> recording.to_dict()
            {'id': 'meeting',
             'sources': [{'type': 'file',
               'channels': [0],
               'source': 'meeting.wav'}],
             'sampling_rate': 16000,
             'num_samples': 57600000,
             'duration': 3600.0}

        Recordings can be also created programatically, e.g. when they refer to URLs stored in S3 or somewhere else::

            >>> s3_audio_files = ['s3://my-bucket/123-5678.flac', ...]
            >>> recs = RecordingSet.from_recordings(
            ...     Recording(
            ...         id=url.split('/')[-1].replace('.flac', ''),
            ...         sources=[AudioSource(type='url', source=url, channels=[0])],
            ...         sampling_rate=16000,
            ...         num_samples=get_num_samples(url),
            ...         duration=get_duration(url)
            ...     )
            ...     for url in s3_audio_files
            ... )

        It allows reading a subset of the audio samples as a numpy array::

            >>> samples = recording.load_audio()
            >>> assert samples.shape == (1, 16000)
            >>> samples2 = recording.load_audio(offset=0.5)
            >>> assert samples2.shape == (1, 8000)

class RecordingSet(Serializable, AlgorithmMixin):
    """
    :class:`~lhotse.audio.RecordingSet` represents a collection of recordings, indexed by recording IDs.
    It does not contain any annotation such as the transcript or the speaker identity --
    just the information needed to retrieve a recording such as its path, URL, number of channels,
    and some recording metadata (duration, number of samples).

    It also supports (de)serialization to/from YAML/JSON/etc. and takes care of mapping between
    rich Python classes and YAML/JSON/etc. primitives during conversion.

    When coming from Kaldi, think of it as ``wav.scp`` on steroids: :class:`~lhotse.audio.RecordingSet`
    also has the information from *reco2dur* and *reco2num_samples*,
    is able to represent multi-channel recordings and read a specified subset of channels,
    and support reading audio files directly, via a unix pipe, or downloading them on-the-fly from a URL
    (HTTPS/S3/Azure/GCP/etc.).

    Examples:

        :class:`~lhotse.audio.RecordingSet` can be created from an iterable of :class:`~lhotse.audio.Recording` objects::

            >>> from lhotse import RecordingSet
            >>> audio_paths = ['123-5678.wav', ...]
            >>> recs = RecordingSet.from_recordings(Recording.from_file(p) for p in audio_paths)

        As well as from a directory, which will be scanned recursively for files with parallel processing::

            >>> recs2 = RecordingSet.from_dir('/data/audio', pattern='*.flac', num_jobs=4)

        It behaves similarly to a ``dict``::

            >>> '123-5678' in recs
            True
            >>> recording = recs['123-5678']
            >>> for recording in recs:
            >>>    pass
            >>> len(recs)
            127

        It also provides some utilities for I/O::

            >>> recs.to_file('recordings.jsonl')
            >>> recs.to_file('recordings.json.gz')  # auto-compression
            >>> recs2 = RecordingSet.from_file('recordings.jsonl')

        Manipulation::

            >>> longer_than_5s = recs.filter(lambda r: r.duration > 5)
            >>> first_100 = recs.subset(first=100)
            >>> split_into_4 = recs.split(num_splits=4)
            >>> shuffled = recs.shuffle()

        And lazy data augmentation/transformation, that requires to adjust some information
        in the manifest (e.g., ``num_samples`` or ``duration``).
        Note that in the following examples, the audio is untouched -- the operations are stored in the manifest,
        and executed upon reading the audio::

            >>> recs_sp = recs.perturb_speed(factor=1.1)
            >>> recs_vp = recs.perturb_volume(factor=2.)
            >>> recs_rvb = recs.reverb_rir(rir_recs)
