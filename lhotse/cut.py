# One of the design principles for Cuts is a maximally "lazy" implementation, e.g. when mixing Cuts,

class Cut:
    """
    .. caution::
        :class:`~lhotse.cut.Cut` is just an abstract class -- the actual logic is implemented by its child classes (scroll down for references).

    :class:`~lhotse.cut.Cut` is a base class for audio cuts.
    An "audio cut" is a subset of a :class:`~lhotse.audio.Recording` -- it can also be thought of as a "view"
    or a pointer to a chunk of audio.
    It is not limited to audio data -- cuts may also point to (sub-spans of) precomputed
    :class:`~lhotse.features.base.Features`.

    Cuts are different from :class:`~lhotse.supervision.SupervisionSegment` in that they may be arbitrarily
    longer or shorter than supervisions; cuts may even contain multiple supervisions for creating contextual
    training data, and unsupervised regions that provide real or synthetic acoustic background context
    for the supervised segments.

    The following example visualizes how a cut may represent a part of a single-channel recording with
    two utterances and some background noise in between::

                          Recording
        |-------------------------------------------|
        "Hey, Matt!"     "Yes?"        "Oh, nothing"
        |----------|     |----|        |-----------|
                   Cut1
        |------------------------|

    This scenario can be represented in code, using :class:`~lhotse.cut.MonoCut`, as::

        >>> from lhotse import Recording, SupervisionSegment, MonoCut
        >>> rec = Recording(id='rec1', duration=10.0, sampling_rate=8000, num_samples=80000, sources=[...])
        >>> sups = [
        ...     SupervisionSegment(id='sup1', recording_id='rec1', start=0, duration=3.37, text='Hey, Matt!'),
        ...     SupervisionSegment(id='sup2', recording_id='rec1', start=4.5, duration=0.9, text='Yes?'),
        ...     SupervisionSegment(id='sup3', recording_id='rec1', start=6.9, duration=2.9, text='Oh, nothing'),
        ... ]
        >>> cut = MonoCut(id='rec1-cut1', start=0.0, duration=6.0, channel=0, recording=rec,
        ...     supervisions=[sups[0], sups[1]])

    .. note::
        All Cut classes assume that the :class:`~lhotse.supervision.SupervisionSegment` time boundaries are relative
        to the beginning of the cut.
        E.g. if the underlying :class:`~lhotse.audio.Recording` starts at 0s (always true), the cut starts at 100s,
        and the SupervisionSegment inside the cut starts at 3s, it really did start at 103rd second of the recording.
        In some cases, the supervision might have a negative start, or a duration exceeding the duration of the cut;
        this means that the supervision in the recording extends beyond the cut.

    Cut allows to check and read audio data or features data::

        >>> assert cut.has_recording
        >>> samples = cut.load_audio()
        >>> if cut.has_features:
        ...     feats = cut.load_features()

    It can be visualized, and listened to, inside Jupyter Notebooks::

        >>> cut.plot_audio()
        >>> cut.play_audio()
        >>> cut.plot_features()

    Cuts can be used with Lhotse's :class:`~lhotse.features.base.FeatureExtractor` to compute features.

        >>> from lhotse import Fbank
        >>> feats = cut.compute_features(extractor=Fbank())

    It is also possible to use a :class:`~lhotse.features.io.FeaturesWriter` to store the features and attach
    their manifest to a copy of the cut::

        >>> from lhotse import LilcomChunkyWriter
        >>> with LilcomChunkyWriter('feats.lca') as storage:
        ...     cut_with_feats = cut.compute_and_store_features(
        ...         extractor=Fbank(),
        ...         storage=storage
        ...     )

    Cuts have several methods that allow their manipulation, transformation, and mixing.
    Some examples (see the respective methods documentation for details)::

        >>> cut_2_to_4s = cut.truncate(offset=2, duration=2)
        >>> cut_padded = cut.pad(duration=10.0)
        >>> cut_extended = cut.extend_by(duration=5.0, direction='both')
        >>> cut_mixed = cut.mix(other_cut, offset_other_by=5.0, snr=20)
        >>> cut_append = cut.append(other_cut)
        >>> cut_24k = cut.resample(24000)
        >>> cut_sp = cut.perturb_speed(1.1)
        >>> cut_vp = cut.perturb_volume(2.)
        >>> cut_rvb = cut.reverb_rir(rir_recording)

    .. note::
        All cut transformations are performed lazily, on-the-fly, upon calling ``load_audio`` or ``load_features``.
        The stored waveforms and features are untouched.

    .. caution::
        Operations on cuts are not mutating -- they return modified copies of :class:`.Cut` objects,
        leaving the original object unmodified.

    A :class:`.Cut` that contains multiple segments (:class:`SupervisionSegment`) can be decayed into
    smaller cuts that correspond directly to supervisions::

        >>> smaller_cuts = cut.trim_to_supervisions()

    Cuts can be detached from parts of their metadata::

        >>> cut_no_feat = cut.drop_features()
        >>> cut_no_rec = cut.drop_recording()
        >>> cut_no_sup = cut.drop_supervisions()

    Finally, cuts provide convenience methods to compute feature frame and audio sample masks for supervised regions::

        >>> sup_frames = cut.supervisions_feature_mask()
        >>> sup_samples = cut.supervisions_audio_mask()

        Returns a new MonoCut that is an extended region of the current MonoCut by extending
        the cut by a fixed duration in the specified direction.

        Note that no operation is done on the actual features or recording -
        it's only during the call to :meth:`MonoCut.load_features` / :meth:`MonoCut.load_audio`
        when the actual changes happen (an extended version of features/audio is loaded).

        .. hint::

            This method extends a cut by a given duration, either to the left or to the right (or both), using
            the "real" content of the recording that the cut is part of. For example, a MonoCut spanning
            the region from 2s to 5s in a recording, when extended by 2s to the right, will now span
            the region from 2s to 7s in the same recording (provided the recording length exceeds 7s).
            If the recording is shorter, the cut will only be extended up to the duration of the recording.
            To "expand" a cut by padding, use :meth:`MonoCut.pad`. To "truncate" a cut, use :meth:`MonoCut.truncate`.

        .. hint::

            If `direction` is "both", the resulting cut will be extended by the specified duration in
            both directions. This is different from the usage in :meth:`MonoCut.pad` where a padding
            equal to 0.5*duration is added to both sides.

        :param duration: float (seconds), specifies the duration by which the cut should be extended.
        :param direction: string, 'left', 'right' or 'both'. Determines whether to extend on the left,
            right, or both sides. If 'both', extend on both sides by the duration specified in `duration`.

class MixedCut(Cut):
    """
    :class:`~lhotse.cut.MixedCut` is a :class:`~lhotse.cut.Cut` that actually consists of multiple other cuts.
    It can be interpreted as a multi-channel cut, but its primary purpose is to allow
    time-domain and feature-domain augmentation via mixing the training cuts with noise, music, and babble cuts.
    The actual mixing operations are performed on-the-fly.

    Internally, :class:`~lhotse.cut.MixedCut` holds other cuts in multiple trakcs (:class:`~lhotse.cut.MixTrack`),
    each with its own offset and SNR that is relative to the first track.

    Please refer to the documentation of :class:`~lhotse.cut.Cut` to learn more about using cuts.

    In addition to methods available in :class:`~lhotse.cut.Cut`, :class:`~lhotse.cut.MixedCut` provides the methods to
    read all of its tracks audio and features as separate channels:

        >>> cut = MixedCut(...)
        >>> mono_features = cut.load_features()
        >>> assert len(mono_features.shape) == 2
        >>> multi_features = cut.load_features(mixed=False)
        >>> # Now, the first dimension is the channel.
        >>> assert len(multi_features.shape) == 3

class CutSet(Serializable, AlgorithmMixin):
    """
    :class:`~lhotse.cut.CutSet` represents a collection of cuts, indexed by cut IDs.
    CutSet ties together all types of data -- audio, features and supervisions, and is suitable to represent
    training/dev/test sets.

    .. note::
        :class:`~lhotse.cut.CutSet` is the basic building block of PyTorch-style Datasets for speech/audio processing tasks.

    When coming from Kaldi, there is really no good equivalent -- the closest concept may be Kaldi's "egs" for training
    neural networks, which are chunks of feature matrices and corresponding alignments used respectively as inputs and
    supervisions. :class:`~lhotse.cut.CutSet` is different because it provides you with all kinds of metadata,
    and you can select just the interesting bits to feed them to your models.

    :class:`~lhotse.cut.CutSet` can be created from any combination of :class:`~lhotse.audio.RecordingSet`,
    :class:`~lhotse.supervision.SupervisionSet`, and :class:`~lhotse.features.base.FeatureSet`
    with :meth:`lhotse.cut.CutSet.from_manifests`::

        >>> from lhotse import CutSet
        >>> cuts = CutSet.from_manifests(recordings=my_recording_set)
        >>> cuts2 = CutSet.from_manifests(features=my_feature_set)
        >>> cuts3 = CutSet.from_manifests(
        ...     recordings=my_recording_set,
        ...     features=my_feature_set,
        ...     supervisions=my_supervision_set,
        ... )

    When creating a :class:`.CutSet` with :meth:`.CutSet.from_manifests`, the resulting cuts will have the same duration
    as the input recordings or features. For long recordings, it is not viable for training.
    We provide several methods to transform the cuts into shorter ones.

    Consider the following scenario::

                          Recording
        |-------------------------------------------|
        "Hey, Matt!"     "Yes?"        "Oh, nothing"
        |----------|     |----|        |-----------|

        .......... CutSet.from_manifests() ..........
                            Cut1
        |-------------------------------------------|

        ............. Example CutSet A ..............
            Cut1          Cut2              Cut3
        |----------|     |----|        |-----------|

        ............. Example CutSet B ..............
                  Cut1                  Cut2
        |---------------------||--------------------|

        ............. Example CutSet C ..............
                     Cut1        Cut2
                    |---|      |------|

    The CutSet's A, B and C can be created like::

        >>> cuts_A = cuts.trim_to_supervisions()
        >>> cuts_B = cuts.cut_into_windows(duration=5.0)
        >>> cuts_C = cuts.trim_to_unsupervised_segments()

    .. note::
        Some operations support parallel execution via an optional ``num_jobs`` parameter.
        By default, all processing is single-threaded.

    .. caution::
        Operations on cut sets are not mutating -- they return modified copies of :class:`.CutSet` objects,
        leaving the original object unmodified (and all of its cuts are also unmodified).

    :class:`~lhotse.cut.CutSet` can be stored and read from JSON, JSONL, etc. and supports optional gzip compression::

        >>> cuts.to_file('cuts.jsonl.gz')
        >>> cuts4 = CutSet.from_file('cuts.jsonl.gz')

    It behaves similarly to a ``dict``::

            >>> 'rec1-1-0' in cuts
            True
            >>> cut = cuts['rec1-1-0']
            >>> for cut in cuts:
            >>>    pass
            >>> len(cuts)
            127

    :class:`~lhotse.cut.CutSet` has some convenience properties and methods to gather information about the dataset::

        >>> ids = list(cuts.ids)
        >>> speaker_id_set = cuts.speakers
        >>> # The following prints a message:
        >>> cuts.describe()
        Cuts count: 547
        Total duration (hours): 326.4
        Speech duration (hours): 79.6 (24.4%)
        ***
        Duration statistics (seconds):
        mean    2148.0
        std      870.9
        min      477.0
        25%     1523.0
        50%     2157.0
        75%     2423.0
        max     5415.0
        dtype: float64


    Manipulation examples::

        >>> longer_than_5s = cuts.filter(lambda c: c.duration > 5)
        >>> first_100 = cuts.subset(first=100)
        >>> split_into_4 = cuts.split(num_splits=4)
        >>> shuffled = cuts.shuffle()
        >>> random_sample = cuts.sample(n_cuts=10)
        >>> new_ids = cuts.modify_ids(lambda c: c.id + '-newid')

    These operations can be composed to implement more complex operations, e.g.
    bucketing by duration:

        >>> buckets = cuts.sort_by_duration().split(num_splits=30)

    Cuts in a :class:`.CutSet` can be detached from parts of their metadata::

        >>> cuts_no_feat = cuts.drop_features()
        >>> cuts_no_rec = cuts.drop_recordings()
        >>> cuts_no_sup = cuts.drop_supervisions()

    Sometimes specific sorting patterns are useful when a small CutSet represents a mini-batch::

        >>> cuts = cuts.sort_by_duration(ascending=False)
        >>> cuts = cuts.sort_like(other_cuts)

    :class:`~lhotse.cut.CutSet` offers some batch processing operations::

        >>> cuts = cuts.pad(num_frames=300)  # or duration=30.0
        >>> cuts = cuts.truncate(max_duration=30.0, offset_type='start')  # truncate from start to 30.0s
        >>> cuts = cuts.mix(other_cuts, snr=[10, 30], mix_prob=0.5)

    :class:`~lhotse.cut.CutSet` supports lazy data augmentation/transformation methods which require adjusting some information
    in the manifest (e.g., ``num_samples`` or ``duration``).
    Note that in the following examples, the audio is untouched -- the operations are stored in the manifest,
    and executed upon reading the audio::

        >>> cuts_sp = cuts.perturb_speed(factor=1.1)
        >>> cuts_vp = cuts.perturb_volume(factor=2.)
        >>> cuts_24k = cuts.resample(24000)
        >>> cuts_rvb = cuts.reverb_rir(rir_recordings)

    .. caution::
        If the :class:`.CutSet` contained :class:`~lhotse.features.base.Features` manifests, they will be
        detached after performing audio augmentations such as :meth:`.CutSet.perturb_speed`,
        :meth:`.CutSet.resample`, :meth:`.CutSet.perturb_volume`, or :meth:`.CutSet.reverb_rir`.

    :class:`~lhotse.cut.CutSet` offers parallel feature extraction capabilities
    (see `meth`:.CutSet.compute_and_store_features: for details),
    and can be used to estimate global mean and variance::

        >>> from lhotse import Fbank
        >>> cuts = CutSet()
        >>> cuts = cuts.compute_and_store_features(
        ...     extractor=Fbank(),
        ...     storage_path='/data/feats',
        ...     num_jobs=4
        ... )
        >>> mvn_stats = cuts.compute_global_feature_stats('/data/features/mvn_stats.pkl', max_cuts=10000)

        Provides the ability to read Lhotse objects from a WebDataset tarball (or a
        collection of them, i.e., shards) sequentially, without reading the full contents
        into memory. It also supports passing a list of paths, or WebDataset-style pipes.

        CutSets stored in this format are potentially much faster to read from due to
        sequential I/O (we observed speedups of 50-100x vs random-read mechanisms).

        Since this mode does not support random access reads, some methods of CutSet
        might not work properly (e.g. ``len()``).

        The behaviour of the underlying ``WebDataset`` instance can be customized by
        providing its kwargs directly to the constructor of this class. For details,
        see :func:`lhotse.dataset.webdataset.mini_webdataset` documentation.

            the start/end/duration times of the cut and its supervisions,
            you will end up with incorrect supervision information when using this API.
            E.g. for speed perturbation, use ``CutSet.perturb_speed()`` instead.

            instances, if any are present.
            When False, extract and store the features for each track separately,
            and mix them dynamically when loading the features.

        Extract features for all cuts in batches.
        This method is intended for use with compatible feature extractors that
        implement an accelerated :meth:`~lhotse.FeatureExtractor.extract_batch` method.
        For example, ``kaldifeat`` extractors can be used this way (see, e.g.,
        :class:`~lhotse.KaldifeatFbank` or :class:`~lhotse.KaldifeatMfcc`).

        When a CUDA GPU is available and enabled for the feature extractor, this can
        be much faster than :meth:`.CutSet.compute_and_store_features`.
        Otherwise, the speed will be comparable to single-threaded extraction.

        Example: extract fbank features on one GPU, using 4 dataloading workers
        for reading audio, and store the arrays in an archive file with
        lilcom compression::

            >>> from lhotse import KaldifeatFbank, KaldifeatFbankConfig
            >>> extractor = KaldifeatFbank(KaldifeatFbankConfig(device='cuda'))
            >>> cuts = CutSet(...)
            ... cuts = cuts.compute_and_store_features_batch(
            ...     extractor=extractor,
            ...     storage_path='feats',
            ...     batch_duration=500,
            ...     num_workers=4,
            ... )

        :param extractor: A :class:`~lhotse.features.base.FeatureExtractor` instance,
            which should implement an accelerated ``extract_batch`` method.
        :param storage_path: The path to location where we will store the features.
            The exact type and layout of stored files will be dictated by the
            ``storage_type`` argument.
        :param manifest_path: Optional path where to write the CutSet manifest
            with attached feature manifests. If not specified, we will be keeping
            all manifests in memory.
        :param batch_duration: The maximum number of audio seconds in a batch.
            Determines batch size dynamically.
        :param num_workers: How many background dataloading workers should be used
            for reading the audio.
        :param augment_fn: an optional callable used for audio augmentation.
            Be careful with the types of augmentations used: if they modify
            the start/end/duration times of the cut and its supervisions,
            you will end up with incorrect supervision information when using this API.
            E.g. for speed perturbation, use ``CutSet.perturb_speed()`` instead.
        :param storage_type: a ``FeaturesWriter`` subclass type.
            It determines how the features are stored to disk,
            e.g. separate file per array, HDF5 files with multiple arrays, etc.
        :param overwrite: should we overwrite the manifest, HDF5 files, etc.
            By default, this method will append to these files if they exist.
        :return: Returns a new ``CutSet`` with ``Features`` manifests attached to the cuts.

    It has some extra requirements:

        - The user must provide an ``output_path``, where we will write the cuts as
            we create them. We'll return a lazily-opened :class:`CutSet` from that file.

        - ``recordings`` and ``features`` (if both provided) have to be of equal length

        - ``supervisions`` (if provided) have to be sorted by ``recording_id``;
            note that there may be multiple supervisions with the same ``recording_id``,
            which is allowed.

    In addition, to prepare cuts in a fully memory-efficient way, make sure that:

        - All input manifests are stored in JSONL format and opened lazily
