        Returns a new Cut (DataCut or MixedCut) that is an extended region of the current DataCut by extending
        the cut by a fixed duration in the specified direction.

        Note that no operation is done on the actual features or recording -
        it's only during the call to :meth:`DataCut.load_features` / :meth:`DataCut.load_audio`
        when the actual changes happen (an extended version of features/audio is loaded).

        .. hint::

            This method extends a cut by a given duration, either to the left or to the right (or both), using
            the "real" content of the recording that the cut is part of. For example, a DataCut spanning
            the region from 2s to 5s in a recording, when extended by 2s to the right, will now span
            the region from 2s to 7s in the same recording (provided the recording length exceeds 7s).
            If the recording is shorter, additional silence will be padded to achieve the desired duration
            by default. This behavior can be changed by setting ``pad_silence=False``.
            Also see :meth:`DataCut.pad` which pads a cut "to" a specified length.
            To "truncate" a cut, use :meth:`DataCut.truncate`.

        .. hint::

            If `pad_silence` is set to False, then the cut will be extended only as much as allowed
            within the recording's boundary.

        .. hint::

            If `direction` is "both", the resulting cut will be extended by the specified duration in
            both directions. This is different from the usage in :meth:`MonoCut.pad` where a padding
            equal to 0.5*duration is added to both sides.

        :param duration: float (seconds), specifies the duration by which the cut should be extended.

        :param pad_silence: bool. Should the cut be padded with silence if the recording is shorter than
            the desired duration. If False, the cut will be extended only as much as allowed within the
            recording's boundary.
