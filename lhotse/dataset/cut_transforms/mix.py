        :param cuts: a ``CutSet`` containing augmentation data, e.g. noise, music, babble.
        :param snr: either a float, a pair (range) of floats, or ``None``.
            It determines the SNR of the speech signal vs the noise signal that's mixed into it.
            When a range is specified, we will uniformly sample SNR in that range.
            When it's ``None``, the noise will be mixed as-is -- i.e. without any level adjustment.
            Note that it's different from ``snr=0``, which will adjust the noise level so that the SNR is 0.
        :param prob: a float probability in range [0, 1].
            Specifies the probability with which we will mix augment the cuts.
        :param pad_to_longest: when `True`, each processed :class:`CutSet` will be padded with noise
            to match the duration of the longest Cut in a batch.
        :param preserve_id: When ``True``, preserves the IDs the cuts had before augmentation.
            Otherwise, new random IDs are generated for the augmented cuts (default).
