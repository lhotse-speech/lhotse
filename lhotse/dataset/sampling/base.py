class CutSampler(Sampler):
    """
    ``CutSampler`` is responsible for collecting batches of cuts, given specified criteria.
    It implements correct handling of distributed sampling in ``DataLoader``,
    so that the cuts are not duplicated across workers.

    Sampling in a ``CutSampler`` is intended to be very quick - it only uses the metadata in
    ``CutSet`` manifest to select the cuts, and is not intended to perform any I/O.

    CutSampler works similarly to PyTorch's DistributedSampler - when :attr:`shuffle=True`,
    you should call ``sampler.set_epoch(epoch)`` at each new epoch to have a different
    ordering of returned elements. However, its actual behaviour is different than that of
    DistributedSampler -- instead of partitioning the underlying cuts into equally sized chunks,
    it will return every N-th batch and skip the other batches (where ``N == world_size``).
    The formula used to determine which batches are returned is:
    ``(batch_idx + (world_size - rank)) % world_size == 0``.
    This ensures that we can return an equal number of batches in all distributed workers
    in spite of using a dynamic batch size, at the cost of skipping at most ``world_size - 1`` batches.

    Example usage::

        >>> dataset = K2SpeechRecognitionDataset(cuts)
        >>> sampler = SimpleCutSampler(cuts, max_duration=200, shuffle=True)
        >>> loader = DataLoader(dataset, sampler=sampler, batch_size=None)
        >>> for epoch in range(start_epoch, n_epochs):
        ...     sampler.set_epoch(epoch)
        ...     train(loader)

    .. note::

        For implementers of new samplers:
        Subclasses of CutSampler are expected to implement ``self._next_batch()`` to introduce specific
        sampling logic (e.g. based on filters such as max number of frames/tokens/etc.).
        CutSampler defines ``__iter__()``, which optionally shuffles the cut IDs, and resets
        ``self.cut_idx`` to zero (to be used and incremented inside of ``_next_batch()``.
