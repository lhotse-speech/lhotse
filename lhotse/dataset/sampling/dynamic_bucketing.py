class DynamicBucketingSampler(CutSampler):
    """
    A dynamic (streaming) variant of :class:`~lhotse.dataset.sampling.bucketing.BucketingSampler`,
    that doesn't require reading the whole cut set into memory.

    The basic idea is to sample N (e.g. ~10k) cuts and estimate the boundary durations for buckets.
    Then, we maintain a buffer of M cuts (stored separately in K buckets) and every time we sample a batch,
    we consume the input cut iterable for the same amount of cuts.
    The memory consumption is limited by M at all times.

    For scenarios such as ASR, VAD, Speaker ID, or TTS training, this class supports single CutSet
    iteration. Example::

        >>> cuts = CutSet(...)
        >>> sampler = DynamicBucketingSampler(cuts, max_duration=100)
        >>> for batch in sampler:
        ...     assert isinstance(batch, CutSet)

    For other scenarios that require pairs (or triplets, etc.) of utterances, this class supports
    zipping multiple CutSets together. Such scenarios could be voice conversion, speech translation,
    contrastive self-supervised training, etc. Example::

        >>> source_cuts = CutSet(...)
        >>> target_cuts = CutSet(...)
        >>> sampler = DynamicBucketingSampler(source_cuts, target_cuts, max_duration=100)
        >>> for batch in sampler:
        ...     assert isinstance(batch, tuple)
        ...     assert len(batch) == 2
        ...     assert isinstance(batch[0], CutSet)
        ...     assert isinstance(batch[1], CutSet)

    .. note:: for cut pairs, triplets, etc. the user is responsible for ensuring that the CutSets
        are all sorted so that when iterated over sequentially, the items are matched.
        We take care of preserving the right ordering internally, e.g., when shuffling.
        By default, we check that the cut IDs are matching, but that can be disabled.

    .. caution:: when using :meth:`DynamicBucketingSampler.filter` to filter some cuts with more than
        one CutSet to sample from, we sample one cut from every CutSet, and expect that all of the cuts
        satisfy the predicate -- otherwise, they are all discarded from being sampled.

            Note: with multiple CutSets, ``max_duration`` constraint applies only to the first CutSet.
        :param max_cuts: The maximum total number of ``cuts`` per batch.
            When only ``max_duration`` is specified, this sampler yields static batch sizes.
        :param num_buckets: how many buckets to create.
        :param shuffle: When ``True``, the cuts will be shuffled dynamically with
            a reservoir-sampling-based algorithm.
            Convenient when mini-batch loop is inside an outer epoch-level loop, e.g.:
            `for epoch in range(10): for batch in dataset: ...` as every epoch will see a
            different cuts order.
        :param drop_last: When ``True``, we will drop all incomplete batches.
            A batch is considered incomplete if it depleted a bucket before
            hitting the constraint such as max_duration, max_cuts, etc.
        :param consistent_ids: Only affects processing of multiple CutSets.
            When ``True``, at each sampling step we check cuts from all CutSets have the same ID
            (i.e., the first cut from every CutSet should have the same ID, same for the second, third, etc.).
        :param duration_bins: A list of floats (seconds); when provided, we'll skip the initial
            estimation of bucket duration bins (useful to speed-up the launching of experiments).
        :param num_cuts_for_bins_estimate: We will draw this many cuts to estimate the duration bins
            for creating similar-duration buckets.
            Larger number means a better estimate to the data distribution, possibly at a longer init cost.
        :param buffer_size: How many cuts (or cut pairs, triplets) we hold at any time across all
            of the buckets.
            Increasing ``max_duration`` (batch_size) or ``num_buckets`` might require increasing this number.
            Larger number here will also improve shuffling capabilities.
            It will result in larger memory usage.
        :param quadratic_duration: When set, it adds an extra penalty that's quadratic in size w.r.t.
            a cuts duration. This helps get a more even GPU utilization across different input lengths
            when models have quadratic input complexity. Set between 15 and 40 for transformers.
        :param sync_buckets: When set, we'll try to make each DDP rank sample from as close
            duration buckets as possible to minimize the tail worker effect.
        :param world_size: Total number of distributed nodes. We will try to infer it by default.
