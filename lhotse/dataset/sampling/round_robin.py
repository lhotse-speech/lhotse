class RoundRobinSampler(CutSampler):
    """
    :class:`.RoundRobinSampler` takes several samplers as input, and yields
    a mini-batch of cuts from each of those samplers in turn.
    E.g., with two samplers, the first mini-batch is from ``sampler0``,
    the seconds from ``sampler1``, the third from ``sampler0``, and so on.
    It is helpful for alternating mini-batches from multiple datasets or manually
    creating batches of different sizes.

    The input samplers do not have to provide the same number of batches -- when
    any of the samplers becomes depleted, we continue to iterate the non-depleted
    samplers, until all of them are exhausted.

    Example::

        >>> sampler = RoundRobinSampler(
        ...     SimpleCutSampler(cuts_corpusA, max_cuts=32, shuffle=True),
        ...     SimpleCutSampler(cuts_corpusB, max_cuts=64, shuffle=True),
