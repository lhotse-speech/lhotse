class ZipSampler(CutSampler):

    :class:`.ZipSampler` takes several samplers as input and concatenates their
    sampled mini-batch cuts together into a single :class:`~lhotse.cut.CutSet`,
    or returns a tuple of the mini-batch CutSets.
    It is helpful for ensuring that each batch consists of some proportion of cuts
    coming from different sources.

    The input samplers do not have to provide the same number of batches -- when
    any of the samplers becomes depleted, the iteration will stop (like with
    Python's ``zip()`` function).

    Example::

        >>> sampler = ZipSampler(
        ...     SimpleCutSampler(cuts_corpusA, max_duration=250, shuffle=True),
        ...     SimpleCutSampler(cuts_corpusB, max_duration=100, shuffle=True),
