    The base class for all feature extractors in Lhotse.
    It is initialized with a config object, specific to a particular feature extraction method.
    The config is expected to be a dataclass so that it can be easily serialized.

    All derived feature extractors must implement at least the following:

    * a ``name`` class attribute (how are these features called, e.g. 'mfcc')
    * a ``config_type`` class attribute that points to the configuration dataclass type
    * the ``extract`` method,
    * the ``frame_shift`` property.

    Feature extractors that support feature-domain mixing should additionally specify two static methods:

    * ``compute_energy``, and
    * ``mix``.

    By itself, the ``FeatureExtractor`` offers the following high-level methods
    that are not intended for overriding:

    * ``extract_from_samples_and_store``
    * ``extract_from_recording_and_store``

    These methods run a larger feature extraction pipeline that involves data augmentation and disk storage.
