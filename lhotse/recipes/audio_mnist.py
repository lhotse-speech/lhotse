About the AudioMNIST corpus

The AudioMNIST dataset consists of 30000 audio recordings
(ca. 9.5 hours) of spoken digits (0-9) in English with 50 repetitions
per digit for each of the 60 different speakers. Recordings were
collected in quiet offices with a RÃ˜DE NT-USB microphone as
mono channel signal at a sampling frequency of 48kHz and were
saved in 16 bit integer format. In addition to audio recordings, meta
information including age (range: 22 - 61 years), gender (12 female
/ 48 male), origin and accent of all speakers were collected as well.
All speakers were informed about the intent of the data collection
and have given written declarations of consent for their participation prior
to their recording session.

We don't provide download_audio_mnist().

The data is publicly available at the following github repo:
