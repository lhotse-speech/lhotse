"""
This recipe prepares data collected from radio streamed on the web. The data
have some metadata attached to them, including the geographic location of
broadcast, date and time of the recorded clip, as well as a unique station
identifier.

Obtaining the data
-----------------------------------------------------------
If you want to use this corpus please email: wiesner@jhu.edu

As the data are collected from radio stream, they cannot be broadly
disseminated or used for commercial purposes. In the email, include your
affiliated academic institution and the intended use for the data and we will
the data to you if it is indeed for non-commercial, academic purporses.

Description
------------------------------------------------------------
The data consist of âˆ¼4000 hours of speech collected between
September 27, 2023 to October 1, 2023, in 9449 locations all over the world,
from 17171 stations. 

These data were used for Geolocation of speech in order to answer the question,
Where are you from? in the paper 

Where are you from? Geolocating Speech and Applications to Language
Identification, presented at NAACL 2024. Please read for a full descrption
