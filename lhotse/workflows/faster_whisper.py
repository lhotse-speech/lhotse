    Use OpenAI Whisper model via faster-whisper and CTranslate2 to annotate either
    RECORDINGS_MANIFEST, RECORDINGS_DIR, or CUTS_MANIFEST. It will perform automatic segmentation,
    transcription, and language identification. If the first argument is a CutSet, it will
    overwrite the supervisions with the results of the inference.

    Note: this is an experimental feature of Lhotse, and is not guaranteed to yield
    high quality of data.

    See the original repo for more details: https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper

    :param manifest: a ``RecordingSet`` or ``CutSet`` object.
    :param language: specify the language if known upfront, otherwise it will be auto-detected.
    :param model_name: one of available Whisper variants (base, medium, large, etc.).
    :param device: Where to run the inference (cpu, cuda, etc.).
    :param force_nonoverlapping: if True, the Whisper segment time-stamps will be processed to make
        sure they are non-overlapping.
    :param download_root: Not supported by faster-whisper. Argument kept to maintain compatibility
        with annotate_with_whisper. Faster-whisper uses
    :param compute_type: Type to use for computation.
        See https://opennmt.net/CTranslate2/quantization.html.
    :param num_workers: Increasing the number of workers can improve the global throughput at the
        cost of increased memory usage.
    :param vad_filter: If True, use faster-whisper's built-in voice activity detection (SileroVAD).
    :param add_alignments: if True, add word alignments using timestamps obtained using the cross-
        attention pattern and dynamic time warping (Note: Less accurate than forced alignment).
    :param decode_options: additional options to pass to the ``whisper.transcribe`` function.
    :return: a generator of cuts (use ``CutSet.open_writer()`` to write them).
